# Density-Based-Traffic-Light-System-Source

This is a simple traffic light system where an arduino censor will detect if there is a traffic jam (long vehicles queue) when the green light almost ends, it extends the green light for a couple seconds to ease the traffic (applicable when one road is jammed while the other has few vehicles).
